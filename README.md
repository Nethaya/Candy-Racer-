A talented racer in 'Candy Land' decides to participate in a racing competition. During the competition, she accidentally takes a wrong turn and ends up driving in a different route. She recognizes the new route she's driving in. She's in the most dangerous road of Candy Land called the 'Candy Snaps Road'. This road has magical, poisonous candy bushes that promptly grow everywhere. The racer has to avoid touching the bushes while trying to collect candy jars and coins to survive.
